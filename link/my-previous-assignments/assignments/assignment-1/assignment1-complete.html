        Back in the day, websites were simple, static text sites with a bit of formatting and maybe even some animation. That was all thanks to HTML and CSS. But how did we get from there to today, where we interact with sites, fill out forms, play videos, and load parts of other websites within a page—all without clicking refresh?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It’s important to note that front-end development has changed significantly over the past 10 to 15 years with the explosive growth of JavaScript, which wasn’t as ubiquitous on the front end as it is now, or even as common on the back end, thanks to Node.js. Before JavaScript was such a big player, even a PHP developer could work in front-end development—a crossover that’s less common now than it was then.
    </p>
    
    <p>Some of the core technologies used in front-end web development include:</p>
    
    <h2>HTML: The Organizer</h2>
    <p>HTML is how every site on the web is organized, so it’s a big one you can’t live without in front-end development.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="(https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/advantages-of-html5/)">HTML5</a> is the latest HTML specification. Get a full run-down of this evolving backbone of front-end web technology and learn about one of its cooler features, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">Canvas</a>
        </li>
    
        <li>
            We know HTML is a markup language—but what’s a markup language? <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)">Learn all about these foundational web technologies and what they do.</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>JavaScript: The Multitasker</h2>
    <p>
        What was once a supplementary tool to make web pages more interactive is now the most ubiquitous client-side technology. JavaScript is more than just a language—it’s an entire ecosystem that spans frameworks, task runners, server-side development, and more. Do a deep dive into this fundamental front-end technology and find out more about important technologies such as: <strong>Angualar</strong>, <strong>ReactJS</strong>, and <strong>VueJS</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>CSS: The Stylist</h2>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are how developers add styling and effects to a website. Styles can be added globally, then layered on without changing that fundamental styling that gets applied to a whole site.
    </p>
    
    <p>Here are a few best practices for css:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make it Readable</li>
        <li>Create Your HTML First</li>
        <li>Understand the Difference Between Block vs. Inline Elements</li>        
    </ol>
