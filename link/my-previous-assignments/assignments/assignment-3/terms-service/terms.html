<!--

    The webpage must:
1. Have an input field for the users name
2. Have an input field for the users email address
3. Have an input field for the users password
4. Have an input field for the users password confirmation
5. All these fields are required
6. These fields should be wrapped in a form tag
7. You should include a submit button
8. The submit button should also be in the form tag
9. The form should not submit unless all the fields are filled out
10. A checkbox input that users must check to agree to the terms and conditions.
11. A link in the label field on the checkbox that links to another page that you create that contains the "terms and conditions". The terms and conditions page can actually be an empty HTML page, but simply linking 2 pages together is the challenge.

12. Labels for all the input fields
13. Placeholders in all the input fields
14. There should be an large image centred on the page
15. There should be a header with a 'fake' website name inside that spans the top of the page.

    Nice to haves:
a) An icon on the submit button
b) A footer that fixed to the bottom of the page
c) Centred inputs and submit buttons
d) The link to the terms and conditions page should open up in a new browser tab, not in the current browser tab.
e) The button has a hover state that causes it to change color when the user hovers their mouse over it.
